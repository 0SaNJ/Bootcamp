My Journey Through Bootcamp

Who am I?
---------

Hi everyone my name is Jay, Jay Princeton Sanmohadi. I am from Suriname, born and raised. I am currently 17 years of age. I am currently in my 2nd year of High School. VOS Welgedacht C class V504.

My hobbies are soccer and coding and a lil bit of games. I was always interested in the I.C.T. world and wanted to become something in that world. And last year in the month of September I stumbled upon a program called the inno-starter sponsored by Tullow-Oil and run ( managed ) by the lovely Miss Julie Sundar.

So I conveniently decided to sign up for I found it very helpful in my career into becoming a coder. And within a few months I managed to graduate. While I was in the inno-starter I also participated in the Hacko-topia where I did not win but I managed to impress some of the judges. And a few days later Miss Julie asked me if I would like to join another program of hers called Codettes Bootcamp where I would study various I.T. related things.

And now won't you join me as I embark on this journey of the Codettes Bootcamp on a day to day basis.

Day 1 (10-2-23)
---------------

### Objective:

Our objective was to learn how to host our doc using github and markdown. First we needed to download some apps and files and then we can use google docs to make a "sketch" of our page and then we use a converter to convert it into markdown text and then we go to Notepad++ to edit the file there and we save it and we using github desktop as the middle man to send out the info out to the web. And that's a rough explanation on how we got to what you are seeing now. So appreciate our hard work hmph!!

Day 2 (17-2-23) 
----------------

### Objective:

Our objective was to learn how to work with an esp32 and for our first assignment we had to wire and connect 2 leds and make them turn on, via our browser. And we did that using the languages C++, HTML and CSS and we downloaded our code and then sent it to our Esp32. But not without setting up our Arduino ide up first bc if we didn't we would not have been able to send out the code to the Esp32. So we did that first and from there on we sent our code out to the Esp32 and then we got it working.

### Components: 

1.  Esp32

2.  2x leds

3.  Breadboard

4.  2x resistors

### Screenshots ( Hardware )

### Mistakes:

No mistakes to speak of

Day 3 (24-2-23)
---------------

### Objective:

Our assignment this time was to control our leds using sliders. By using the same principles as the last day, download the code and then send it to the Esp32. And then
